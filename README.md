Implemente several prediciton models to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers based on the features provided.
Ecommerce Company Revenue Prediction

Problem Statement: An Ecommerce company sells clothing online and offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers visit the store for advice sessions with personal stylists and later order clothes online via a mobile app or website. The company seeks to determine whether they should focus more on enhancing the mobile app experience or the website to increase revenue.

Dataset Details: The dataset, Ecommerce Customers.csv, contains customer information such as Email, Address, and Avatar, along with numerical features:

Avg. Session Length: Average duration of in-store style advice sessions in minutes.
Time on App: Average time spent on the mobile app in minutes.
Time on Website: Average time spent on the website in minutes.
Length of Membership: The number of years a customer has been a member.
Yearly Amount Spent: Total yearly expenditure of the customer in dollars (target variable).
Business Objective: The goal is to interpret which variables significantly contribute to the yearly amount spent and to build a predictive model that can help the company make informed decisions about resource allocation towards either the mobile app or website.

Algorithms Used:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)
Solution: Implemented several regression models to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers based on the features provided. The models were evaluated using a validation set to determine the one with the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
At the ended,model is implemented using Linear Regression model
